Frequent consumer group rebalances
**********************************

Consumer group rebalances are a natural event in |ak|, but negative effects happen when a group is
rebalancing too often.

This scenario will look at metrics from various sources. Consumer lag metrics are pulled from the
`kafka-lag-exporter <https://github.com/lightbend/kafka-lag-exporter>`__ container, a scala open source project
that collects data about consumer groups and presents them in a Prometheus scrapable format. Metrics
about |ccloud| cluster resource usage are pulled from the Metrics API endpoints. Consumer client metrics
are pulled from the client applicationâ€™s MBean object ``kafka.consumer:type=consumer-fetch-manager-metrics,client-id=<client_id>``.
