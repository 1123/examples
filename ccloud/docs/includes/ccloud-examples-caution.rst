Any |ccloud| example uses real |ccloud| resources.
A |ccloud| may create |ccloud| environments, clusters, topics, ACLs, service accounts, a ksqlDB application, and potentially other |ccloud| resources that are billable.
To avoid unexpected charges, carefully `evaluate the cost of resources <https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/billing/index.html>`__ before launching any example.
After you are done running a |ccloud| example, manually verify that all |ccloud| resources are destroyed.
